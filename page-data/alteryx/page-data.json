yxdb is optimized for alteryx, since it has same data types etc. as that of alteryx, unlike csvs, where everything is treated as a string, so we need to change them using alteryx first</li>\n<li>data types supported inside alteryx -\n<ul>\n<li>string - for qualitative attributes like ids, names, etc. i.e. not used for numerical operations. can be of type variable (if length of the string is not deterministic) or fixed</li>\n<li>numeric - e.g. height of a tree. there are seven types - byte (0 to 255), int16 (-2<sup>15</sup> to 2<sup>15</sup>-1), int32, int64, fixed, float and double (double has higher precision than float, fixed is for custom needs)</li>\n<li>datetime - can be date, time or a combination of both</li>\n<li>boolean</li>\n<li>spatial</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>“browse tool” for an in depth analysis like values occurring the most, average, nullable values, etc</li>\n<li>note - browse tool can slow down our workflow, so we can “Disable All Browse Tools” from the “runtime” tab</li>\n<li>use the “text input” tool for manual input</li>\n<li>annotations - the “annotation” tab for a tool can be used for changing the name (the text displayed on hovering over the tool) and the annotation (the text displayed below the tool)</li>\n<li>we can output data to for e.g. excel using the “output data” tool. configuration around things like take backup of previous file version, append / overwrite data, etc</li>\n<li>“date time now” tool for the current date and time, with a configurable date format</li>\n<li>“data cleansing” tool to remove whitespace, null rows, columns, etc</li>\n<li>it can also be used to convert all cells to uppercase, lowercase, etc</li>\n<li>“select” tool to change the datatype of a column, remove columns, change column ordering or column names</li>\n<li>note - it has an “unknown” column at the end i.e. if the source is changing and now includes more columns than anticipated by the select tool, the output of the select tool will include them. if we uncheck this “unknown” column, the select tool will discard new fields in its output</li>\n<li>some tools like join tools contain an embedded select tool. this way, we do not have to yet another select tool to the workflow after the join tool</li>\n<li>“auto field” tool to automatically recognize data types of columns</li>\n<li>“date” tool to convert a column to type date. note - select tool could not automatically convert a column in csv to type date. so using the date tool, we are able to specify the expected date format of the input, which is why we place it before the select tool, so that the select tool can then see the column as type date</li>\n<li>“sort” tool to sort data</li>\n<li>the dictionary order option in sort tool can be checked, which accounts for special characters etc</li>\n<li>“filter” tool to filter data. it has two outputs - true, which has rows which satisfy the condition and false for vice versa. the conditions change based on the data type of the column. in the configuration, the basic filter allows us to choose functions and comparisons from a dropdown, while the advanced filter lets us write custom formulae, e.g. basic filter only works when filtering using one column, but custom filter can work with multiple columns - <code class=\"language-text\">[Date] >= \"2022-01-01\" AND [Date] >= \"2023-01-01\" AND [Department] = 4</code></li>\n<li>“formula” tool can be used for e.g. to replace <code class=\"language-text\">,</code> in input to <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> i.e. format decimal numbers correctly - <code class=\"language-text\">Replace([Column Name], \",\", \".\")</code>. alteryx has autocomplete to help with this</li>\n<li>note - we can replace existing column / add new columns with tools like date, formula, etc. note - when modifying an existing column, its data type cannot be changed using the formula tool</li>\n<li>in the ui, fx is for inserting functions, conditions, etc. while X is for inserting columns, constants, etc</li>\n<li>data preview in formula tool shows the result of applying it on the first row of the data</li>\n<li>conditional statements in alteryx -\n<ul>\n<li>if then statements - <code class=\"language-text\">if ([Day] = \"Sat\" or [Day] = \"Sun\") then 1 else 0 endif</code>\n<ul>\n<li>for multiple conditions, can add a combination of <code class=\"language-text\">elseif then</code> like <code class=\"language-text\">if then</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>inline if - <code class=\"language-text\">iif ([Day] = \"Sat\" or [Day] = \"Sun\", 1, 0)</code></li>\n<li>switch - the equivalent of the below\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">if [Category] = \"Long\" then 1\nelseif [Category] = \"Medium\" then 2\nelseif [Category] = \"Short\" then 3\nelse Null()\nendif</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\nusing switch statement would be -\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">switch([Category], Null(), \"Long\", 1, \"Medium\", 2, \"Short\", 3)</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span></span></pre></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>some functions -\n<ul>\n<li>string functions - Trim (e.g. usage - Trim([Name], ‘0’)), TrimLeft, TrimRight, Replace (a sequence of characters can be replaced by another sequence of characters), ReplaceFirst (only touches the first occurrence), ReplaceChar (anywhere the column has one of the listed set of characters, replace it by the alternative specified), LowerCase, UpperCase, TitleCase (any alphabet following a non alphabet is capitalized, e.g. <a href=\"mailto:John.Doe@Email.Com\">John.Doe@Email.Com</a>)</li>\n<li>numeric functions - the standard operators around addition, multiplication, etc., Ceil (round up to the nearest integer), Floor (round down to the nearest integer), Round (round to the nearest multiple specified), SmartRound (round to the nearest multiple decided by alteryx based on spread of values)</li>\n<li>value of null and empty values are not the same thing. null can be used inside for instance, the <code class=\"language-text\">then</code> clause of if then statements using <code class=\"language-text\">Null()</code>. we can check if a cell is null using <code class=\"language-text\">IsNull()</code>, and check if a cell has <u>either</u> empty value or null</u> using <code class=\"language-text\">IsEmpty()</code></li>\n<li>datetime functions - fields of type datetime can contain either only date, or only time, or both date and time. DateTimeAdd - add a number in the specified format to a date, e.g. maturity date calculation - <code class=\"language-text\">DateTimeAdd([Purchase Date], [Duration], \"months\")</code>. DateTimeDiff for difference between dates, e.g. calculation of days to maturity - <code class=\"language-text\">DateTimeDiff([Maturity Date], DateTimeNow(), \"days\")</code> (a negative value here means already matured). for formatting date as a string (DateTimeFormat), converting date from string to date (date time tool), etc. use specifiers like <code class=\"language-text\">%d</code> and separators like <code class=\"language-text\">:</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>use “record id” tool to add unique identifier to every row</li>\n<li>“multi row formula” tool to calculate running total - since it involves multiple rows. in the group by clause, we would select for e.g. the store column, and the formula we enter would be - <code class=\"language-text\">[Row - 1:Running Total] + [Weekly Sales]</code>. we went just one record back in this example, but we can go multiple records back. also, <code class=\"language-text\">Row-1:Running Total]</code> might not always exist (e.g. a new group is starting). so, we can specify the default value in such cases as well</li>\n<li>“random % sample” tool - to get a random percentage / number of records. can help validate results quickly. it also makes the workflow quicker. use a seed for deterministic results</li>\n<li>the “sample” tool however has more configuration, since we can group here as well. e.g. we group by department and store, and for each group, we get the first 10 records. this can help us evaluate our results quicker and more accurately, since for e.g. running total can renew for every new combination</li>\n<li>there are different options for this tool like first n rows, 1 in n chance of selecting a row and so on</li>\n<li>“unique” tool to only get rows with a unique combination of the columns we select</li>\n<li>it has two outputs for the unique and the duplicate records</li>\n<li>ofcourse it will select the first row and discard the duplicates that come after it in the dataset, so it is common to add a sort tool before the unique tool so we get the optimal row in the output</li>\n<li>“multi field formula” tool for multiple columns, since formula tool only works for one column. my understanding - multi field formula tool is used for applying one formula on multiple columns. my mistake - <del>for multiple formulas on multiple columns, we still need multiple tools</del>. we can use one formula tool for multiple formulas on multiple columns</li>\n<li>“tile” tool - group data based on values. we select a tile method and a numeric column. if we select smart tile as the tile method, a new column with values like -1, 1, 2 and 3 is created. this indicates below average, average, extremely high, etc. (we can choose to output these names as well in a different column). so, the idea is we automatically now know how high or low a value is compared to other values in the same column, and smart tile does this automatically for us. now, we can also select columns in the group clause of this tool. for e.g. if we group by store, the assignment of extremely high vs average would be on a group basis i.e. for a high selling store, a weekly sales of 100000 dollars can be average while for a smaller store, it can be extremely high. we can also configure the cutoffs manually, by selecting the tile method as manual</li>\n<li>“multi field binning” tool for a similar grouping - we select the numeric columns to use, and can set the tool to classify based on either equal records (10 records in each classification) or equal intervals (10-20, 20-30…)</li>\n<li>“create sample” tool for multiple outputs of samples, so like sample tool etc. but with multiple outputs. use case - machine learning where we need different training and validation set</li>\n<li>“join” tool for joins - it has three outputs - “j” for inner join, “l” for left join - inner join and “r” for right join - inner join. note - data type of columns being joined should be same</li>\n<li>we can either join by record position i.e. first row of first table corresponds to first row of second table and so on, or we can join by values in a column (the normal way of joins we are used to)</li>\n<li>note - data type of columns being used to join should be same</li>\n<li>“join multiple” tool for joining multiple tables. it has a checkbox “only output records that join from all inputs” (self-explanatory). my understanding - it is useful when for e.g. store id is present in all three tables. if we want to for e.g. join two tables based on store id, while this resulting join table and a country table based on country id, we would need multiple join tools</li>\n<li>“union” tool for unions. union tool can combine multiple table using one tool unlike the union in sql?</li>\n<li>we can align by column name, column position or by manual alignment (we can align in any custom way e.g. 4th column of first table to 3rd column of second table and so on)</li>\n<li>we can output all columns or only the common subset of columns, and we can change the ordering of the union (i.e. all rows from second table appear before all rows from the first table)</li>\n<li>“find and replace” - suppose we have an auxiliary table with columns old_country and new_country. in another table, we can find all rows with value in column country matching one of those in old_country, and replace it with this auxiliary table’s new_country column</li>\n<li>we can either choose to replace the text, or choose to append columns. e.g. the auxiliary table has reason for change, year of change and so on. now, since the columns of this auxiliary table will have null for other rows that did not match, we can use formula tool with select tool to adjust data accordingly</li>\n<li>the finding can be based on “beginning of field”, “any part of field” or “entire field”</li>\n<li>we can also configure the find to be case-insensitive</li>\n<li>find and replace tool vs join tool</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>find and replace</th>\n<th>join</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>flexibility around matching</td>\n<td>exact matching</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>replace or append</td>\n<td>append</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>no embedded select</td>\n<td>embedded select</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>can only match using string data type</td>\n<td>can match using any data type</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>returns single match (i.e. first?)</td>\n<td>returns all matches</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>“fuzzy match” tool - two options-”purge mode” where all records are compared or “merge”, where only records from different sources are compared. in the second option, we need to specify the source id column. so for e.g. we combine two tables using a union tool and feed the output to a fuzzy match tool, and if we want to apply this fuzzy matching on rows of first table and second table, the fuzzy match tool needs to know for a record what is the source. this is why we have source id column selection for merge and not for purge mode. e.g. recall how when we use regex in file path for input tool, we could specify whether to include the source file name as a column</li>\n<li>then we can select the column to output and finally the method of matching. e.g. by default, algorithms for matching company names, phone number, names, etc. is available out of the box</li>\n<li>“make group” tool - used in conjunction with the fuzzy match tool. output has two columns - group and key. group will have johnson limited always while key will have johnson limited, johnson ltd. johnson ltd, etc. so, we can find by key and replace by group value</li>\n<li>“append” tool - used for cross join</li>\n<li>“regular expression” tool - we can select different output methods like replace on regex, to replace regex, tokenize on regex and so on</li>\n<li>tokenize on regex example - use /d+ i.e. one or more digits so that for e.g. a room text column containing values like 3+1, 10+6 etc. can be broken down to 3 and 1, 10 and 6 and so on respectively. we can also specify how many new columns to use, so this way, the first new column will contain the 3 and 10, the second column 1 and 6 and so on</li>\n<li>“text to columns” tool to convert text to different columns. we specify the delimiters to split based on and the number of columns to split into</li>\n<li>sometimes, some fields can for e.g. include commas and the delimiter itself can be a comma as well. we can configure the text to columns tool to ignore commas enclosed within quotes for instance</li>\n<li>we can also split into different rows instead of columns using this tool</li>\n<li>“summarize” tool - group and aggregate data, e.g. group by store and year, perform average on weekly sales</li>\n<li>“running total” tool for running total - can specify group by clause, e.g. we would want running total of store on per store basis i.e. the running total should start from 0 for every new store it encounters</li>\n<li>“weighted average” tool for weighted average. specify the value field and weight field. we can also specify the columns to group based on e.g. if we specify store, then we get weighted average on a per-store basis</li>\n<li>“transpose” tool converts horizontal to vertical, while “cross tab” tool converts vertical to horizontal</li>\n<li>e.g. when using transpose tool for the following table -</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Size</th>\n<th>Color</th>\n<th>Food</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>small</td>\n<td>red</td>\n<td>apple</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>medium</td>\n<td>blue</td>\n<td>tomato</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>large</td>\n<td>green</td>\n<td>carrot</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>if we choose all columns as “data columns”, we get the below (i.e. output rows under name and its values will only have the columns we select under data columns)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Size</td>\n<td>small</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Color</td>\n<td>red</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Food</td>\n<td>apple</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Size</td>\n<td>medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Color</td>\n<td>blue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Food</td>\n<td>tomato</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Size</td>\n<td>large</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Color</td>\n<td>green</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Food</td>\n<td>carrot</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>now, if we select only size under “key columns” we get -</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"table-wrapper\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Size</th>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Value</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>small</td>\n<td>Color</td>\n<td>red</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>small</td>\n<td>Food</td>\n<td>apple</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>medium</td>\n<td>Color</td>\n<td>blue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>medium</td>\n<td>Food</td>\n<td>tomato</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>large</td>\n<td>Color</td>\n<td>green</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>large</td>\n<td>Food</td>\n<td>carrot</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>“cross tab” tool - e.g. we have a column for month name and a column for weekly sales. if we choose “column headers” to be month name and “value column” to be weekly sales, we will get a table with a new column for every month, and the value inside it would be the value of weekly sales. we need to choose aggregation type, e.g. average. the aggregation types available depends on the data type of the column we chose for the value column. when we run the workflow, other columns would not show up, and we would have 12 total columns (one for each month) and 1 row, showing average weekly sales for that month</li>\n<li>now if we for e.g. group by store and year, we will also have two new columns for store and year, and for every month column we will have average weekly sales for that particular store and year</li>\n<li>note how only one row was created until we specified the group by clause</li>\n<li>when using cross tab, column headers would have <code class=\"language-text\">_</code> for values which had special characters</li>\n<li>“select records” tool is for e.g. used to select n records</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"reporting\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reporting\" aria-label=\"reporting permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reporting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>we have to use the browse tool at the end to view reports</li>\n<li>“table” tool - display like a formatted table. we can create “column rules” for every column to format its cells in a certain way e.g. create a column rule for store column, and the rule says highlight all cells where weekly sales is > 18000. (yes, columns referenced in column rules need not be the same as the column for which the rule is being created). we can also create row rules to apply formatting to entire rows</li>\n<li>“interactive chart” tool for creating charts like pie charts, bar charts, etc. we add and configure “layers”. there are several customizations around colors, fonts, etc. available</li>\n<li>to create a final page with multiple charts and tables - we first use a multi join tool to combine all these different charts and tables. this results in a table with just one row, here each column represents one of the charts / tables. then, we can use multiple layout tools. a full example -\n<ul>\n<li>the multi join tool contains a table, a bar chart and a pie chart as inputs, and outputs a table with one row and three columns, one column for each input (note - the multiple join tool has two ways of joining records, by specific fields, as was discussed in the <a href=\"#joins\">joins</a> section, and by record position. we ofcourse choose record position here)</li>\n<li>the first layout tool combines the bar and pie charts horizontally, and outputs a table with two columns - one representing the combined bar + pie chart and the other for the table</li>\n<li>now we add a second layout tool to combine these two columns vertically</li>\n<li>so, the final output is a table with one row and column i.e. one cell. it contains the table chart and then the bar and pie chart stacked next to each other horizontally</li>\n<li>we can add “report header” and “report footer” tools just before the browse tool</li>\n<li>finally, we can use the “render” tool for rendering in a format we like, e.g. pdf. here, we choose the column to use header, footer and data (that is why see how browse tool can help us determine this - my understanding - everything is a table upto this point)\n<span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;
