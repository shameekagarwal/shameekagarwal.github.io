## Resistance Training

- "resistance training" - helps build muscles
- "weight training" = using free weights and machines
- "body weight training" = using body weight
- body weight training advantages - no special equipment is needed. also, less prone to injuries
- body weight training disadvantages - progressive overload is hard to achieve
- weight training advantages - helps build muscle quicker
- "progressive overload" - creating an environment which forces the body to adapt
- for progressive overload, increasing weights is very very important. this is the best way to build muscles
- formula to build muscles = training + nutrition + rest
- "hypertrophy" - process of building muscle - we damage the muscle fibres, and our body grows back stronger and more muscle fibres
- "compound movements" - work several muscles at once. they are the most effective
- for now, compound movements are much better for me than "isolation movements" i.e. movements that target a specific muscle

## Workout Strategy

- workouts are split into two categories
- they can be done for 4 days in a week, alternating between each other
- how much break to take - 
  - 30 seconds between warmup sets
  - 1.5 min between sets
  - 3 mins between exercises
- remember - we increase reps for "endurance" and increase weights for "strength"
- increasing weight is the right technique for hypertrophy
- "warmup" - lowers risk of injury and activates muscles before exercise
- we do 2 warmup sets per exercise - empty barbell, and then 0.5 times of first actual set

## Full Body Workout 1 Routine

- bench press - 2 warmup sets, 3 actual sets, 8 reps
- barbell row - 2 warmup sets, 3 actual sets, 8 reps
- barbell squats - 2 warmup sets, 3 actual sets, 8 reps
- bicep curls - 2 warmup sets, 3 actual sets, 10 reps

## Full Body Workout 2 Routine

- pull ups - 2 warmup sets, 3 actual sets, 8 reps
- deadlift - 2 warmup sets, 3 actual sets, 8 reps
- military press - 2 warmup sets, 3 actual sets, 8 reps
- tricep push down - 2 warmup sets, 3 actual sets, 10 reps

## Flexibility

- "flexibility" - moving a joint through full range of its motion
- static stretching != warmup - warmup is done using light weights
- mistake 1 - a stretch should be never be done beyond 60 seconds
- mistake 2 - do not hold your breath when stretching
- "static stretching" - bringing muscles to their peak position and holding them there for 15-30 seconds. should be done post-workout
- "dynamic stretching" - moving through a range of motion repeatedly. should be done pre-workout

## Dynamic Stretching Routine - Lower Body

- jumping jacks - 30 seconds
- walking lunges - 10 reps per leg
- knee tucks - 10 reps per leg
- leg swings - 10 reps per leg
- side lunges with a twist - 10 reps per leg

## Dynamic Stretching Routine - Upper Body

- normal arm circles - 10 reps
- normal arm circles (reverse direction) - 10 reps
- large arm circles - 10 reps
- large arm circles (reverse direction) - 10 reps
- pushups - for now, as many as possible in one set

## Static Stretching

- seated back twist
- quad stretch
- hip abductor stretch
- hamstring stretch
- gluteal stretch
- lat stretch
- calf stretch
- lying abdominal stretch
- neck side bend
- shoulder stretch
- tricep stretch
