## Snowflake

- we can create and run queries inside worksheets
- we can see the snowflake_sample_data database by default with some sample data
  ```sql
  select * from snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf1.customer
  ```
- we use snowflake's virtual warehouses for mpp (massive parallel processing). this allows the query to be processed in parallel in small chunks
- virtual warehouse sizes - xs (1 server), s (2 servers), m (4 servers),...4xl (128 servers)
- when not in use, a warehouse can be suspended. configure this behavior automatically using auto suspend and auto resume
- creating warehouses can be done by using the ui / even issuing sql statements in the worksheet
- in the worksheet, we can set the context i.e. the current database, schema and warehouse or use commands like `use warehouse` or `use database`
- multi clustering - when creating a warehouse, we can create it as a cluster and set the minimum and maximum number of warehouses allowed
- i think multi clustering is an enterprise feature, i do not see the option for it in the ui
- based on when load is high, this cluster will automatically add or remove warehouses for us (think asg in aws)
- multi clustering is better for more number of queries, for more complex queries we might need to consider vertical scaling (increase size of warehouse)
- notice difference between **more number of queries** vs **more complex queries**
- so basically there is a queue of the queries, which gets assigned one by one to the warehouses
- scaling policy - standard is the default whereas economy preserves the cost
  - standard - add additional virtual warehouses if there is a task queued
  - economy - add additional virtual warehouses if the estimated time for the current cluster is at least 6 minutes
- optimize virtual warehouse usage - 
  - have dedicated virtual warehouses for different use cases since they have different workload types
  - understand horizontal scaling (more concurrent queries) vs vertical scaling (more complex queries), and choose the right one based on use case
- snowflake editions - **standard**, **enterprise** (has all features of standard with additional features like multi cluster warehouse, time travel upto 90 days as opposed to the 1 day inside standard, materialized views, etc), **business critical** (all features of enterprise with extended support etc) and **virtual private** (think dedicated hosts in aws ec2)
- we are charged for storage (after compression) and compute (warehouse)
- <u>for storage</u>, we have two options to choose between - **on demand** (pay for what you use) and **capacity** (pay upfront)
- 40$ per tb per month for on demand storage, 23$ per tb per month for capacity storage
- for xs virtual warehouse, we consume 1 credit per hour consumed by second i.e. if we consume for half an hour, we use half a credit (minimum is one minute). number of credits consumed by a warehouse depends on size (1 credit per server, so medium would consume 4 credits per hour)
- for virtual warehouse, we are charged in terms of credits. there is a conversion of credit and dollars associated with it. e.g. for cloud provider as aws and in the us-east-1 region - 2$ per credit for compute if using standard edition
- methods of loading data in snowflake - 
  - **bulk / batch loading** - uses our compute. e.g. copy command
  - **continuous loading** - doesn't use our compute, serverless. e.g. snowpipe
- stages - location from where data can be loaded
  - **external** - maintains url, access credentials, etc. e.g. s3 buckets
  - **internal** - local storage maintained by snowflake
- note - there are costs considerations around data transfer when moving data from different regions or different clouds vs same cloud and same region
- creating a stage - 
  ```sql
  create or replace database our_first_db;

  create or replace database manage_db;
  create or replace schema manage_db.external_stages;
  
  create or replace file format manage_db.external_stages.csv_format
    type = csv field_delimiter = ',' skip_header = 1;

  create or replace stage manage_db.external_stages.bucketsnowflakes3
    url = 's3://bucketsnowflakes3'; -- the bucket is unprotected

  list @manage_db.external_stages.bucketsnowflakes3; -- lists files

  create or replace table our_first_db.public.orders (
    order_id varchar(30),
    amount int,
    profit int,
    quantity int,
    category varchar(30),
    subcategory varchar(30)
  );

  copy into our_first_db.public.orders
    from @manage_db.external_stages.bucketsnowflakes3
    file_format = manage_db.external_stages.csv_format
    files = ('OrderDetails.csv');
  ```
- doing some transformations before loading data - 
  ```sql
  copy into orders_ex (order_id, profit, profitable_flag) from (
    select
      s3.$1,
      s3.$2,
      iff(cast(s3.$3 as int) > 0, 'profitable', 'non profitable')
    from
      @manage_db.external_stages.bucketsnowflakes3 s3
  )
  file_format = manage_db.external_stages.csv_format
  files = ('OrderDetails.csv');
  ```
- instead of `files` where we specify the full names of the files in an array like structure, we can specify a regex to match file names using the `pattern` keyword
- lets say we have a column of type integer in the create table statement, but the data in the csv inside s3 is bad and one of the rows in the csv has a string for the corresponding column. we can configure the behavior on encountering an error as follows - 
  ```sql
  -- ...
  files = ('OrderDetails_error.csv')
  on_error = skip_file;
  ```
  the options for `on_error` are - 
  - **abort_statement** - the default. abort the copying and rollback the rows copied
  - **continue** - skip the row where the error happened and continue the loading of data
  - **skip_file** - skip the file where the error happened but continue loading other files. we can also configure the error limit per file in this case, e.g. **skip_file_3** would mean skip the file if three or more errors happen (so skip_file actually means skip_file_1?)
- before actually copying over the data, we can also do a dry run of the copy - this way we can know beforehand if the copying will go through without actually executing it. we configure this using **validation_mode** i.e. if we provide this option, the data is not actually copied
  ```sql
  -- ...
  files = ('OrderDetails_error.csv')
  validation_mode = return_errors;
  ```
  the two options are - 
  - **return_errors** - returns all errors if any during the execution of the entire thing. the output will contain the files where the error occurred, the row number, the reason of the error, etc
  - **return_n_rows** - e.g. return_5_rows would mean perform the validation on only the first 5 rows, and if a failure occurs, throw the exception, and if no, return these 5 rows. note - the difference is this returns the processed rows while the above returns files where exceptions occurred
- if column has type `varchar(10)` but the source csv column has values of larger lengths, the copy command will fail. we can prevent this failure by using `truncatecolumns = true`, so that columns with greater lengths are just truncated i.e. electronics will become electronic
- by default, if we rerun the same copy command more than once, the rows will not be duplicated ðŸ¤¯. we can change this behavior by providing `force = true`. note that this can lead to duplicates
- to view the history of copy commands i.e. source stage, success vs failure count, etc, use - 
  ```sql
  select * from copy_db.information_schema.load_history;
  ```
- note that the command above was for a single database. to view the same thing across databases, use the snowflake db
  ```sql
  select * from snowflake.account_usage.load_history;
  ```
- for loading unstructured data (e.g. json), we might not be able to load it directly like above i.e. csv rows were easily mapping one to one with table rows
- so, we first load the json to a new table which has only one column of type `variant`
- we then transform this data (e.g. flatten) to load into our own tables
  ```sql
  create or replace stage manage_db.public.s3_json
      url = 's3://bucketsnowflake-jsondemo';

  create or replace file format manage_db.public.json
      type = json;

  create or replace table our_first_db.public.json_demo (
      raw_json variant
  );

  copy into our_first_db.public.json_demo
    from @manage_db.public.s3_json
    file_format = manage_db.public.json
    files = ('HR_data.json');
  ```
- now, assume the json has the format as below - 
  ```json
  {
    "city": "Louny",
    "first_name": "Dag",
    "gender": "Male",
    "id": 2,
    "job": {
      "salary": 43000,
      "title": "Clinical Specialist"
    },
    "last_name": "Croney",
    "prev_company": [
      "MacGyver, Kessler and Corwin",
      "Gerlach, Russel and Moen"
    ],
    "spoken_languages": [
      { "language": "Assamese", "level": "Basic" },
      { "language": "Papiamento", "level": "Expert" },
      { "language": "Telugu", "level": "Basic" }
    ]
  }
  ```
- we can for e.g. query city as follows - 
  ```sql
  select raw_json:city from our_first_db.public.json_demo;
  ```
- recall raw_json was the variant column in our table. the output for e.g. of above would be a column containing cells of the format `"Bakersfield"`. so, now to convert this to a string i.e. `Bakersfield` (without quotes), we can do the below -
  ```sql
  select raw_json:city::string from our_first_db.public.json_demo;
  ```
- for nested object e.g. refer job in the json, this would work -
  ```sql
  raw_json:job.salary::int job_salary
  ```
- for nested arrays e.g. refer languages in the json, this would work - note how we can only grab one language at a time since this is like one to many
  ```sql
  raw_json:spoken_languages[0].language::string first_language
  ```
- so, the above solution works for arrays if we are fine with introducing new columns like first_language, second_language, etc
- but what if we want a table that is like if we had to perform a join between employee data and spoken languages - 
  ```sql
  select
      json_demo.raw_json:first_name::string first_name,
      flattened.value:language::string language
  from
      our_first_db.public.json_demo json_demo,
      table(flatten(raw_json:spoken_languages)) flattened;
  ```
- the output of this command would look like this - 

  | first_name | language   |
  | ---------- | ---------- |
  | Portia     | Kazakh     |
  | Portia     | Lao        |
  | Dag        | Assamese   |
  | Dag        | Papiamento |
  | Dag        | Telugu     |

- now theoretically we could have done as below - 
  ```sql
  select
      raw_json:first_name::string first_name,
      raw_json:spoken_languages[0].language::string language
  from
      our_first_db.public.json_demo
  union all
  select
      raw_json:first_name::string first_name,
      raw_json:spoken_languages[1].language::string language
  from
      our_first_db.public.json_demo
  union all
  select
      raw_json:first_name::string first_name,
      raw_json:spoken_languages[2].language::string language
  from
      our_first_db.public.json_demo;
  ```
- _notice the index of spoken_languages above_. the downside is the output would be as follows i.e. there would be nulls inside the language row for people having less than three languages

  | first_name | language    |
  | ---------- | ----------- |
  | Portia     | Kazakh      |
  | Portia     | <i>null</i> |
  | Portia     | <i>null</i> |
  | Dag        | Assamese    |
  | Dag        | Papiamento  |
  | Dag        | Telugu      |

- caching - snowflake has caching enabled by default, and it is cached for 24 hrs. to ensure this however, ensure that queries go on the **same warehouse**. this is why having dedicated virtual warehouses for dedicated groups can help
- we can confirm if the cache was used by clicking on the query id - it shows table scan + aggregation for the first time, and shows query result reuse the second time onwards
- clustering - snowflake creates cluster keys for columns to create micro partitions. this prevents full table scans
- we can explicitly do clustering
  - do it for columns which are usually used in where clauses
  - do it for columns frequently used in joins (similar to above)
  - avoid extremes - 
    - not useful for columns which have too many unique values, e.g. id
    - not useful for columns which have too less unique values, e.g. gender
- we can confirm clustering performance by clicking on the query id - it shows how many total partitions are there and how many partitions are used
- connecting to s3 securely using integration objects - 
  - create an iam role -
    - select the trusted entity as the same account id in which this role is being created
    - select the requires external id parameter and enter a random value here for now
  - above steps result in a trust policy like below. note that both values entered above are placeholders for now -
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::8502136:root"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
          "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
              "sts:ExternalId": "something-random"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  - create an integration object inside snowflake - 
    ```sql
    create or replace storage integration snowflake_s3_demo
      type = external_stage
      storage_provider = s3
      enabled = true
      storage_aws_role_arn = 'arn:aws:iam::8502136:role/SnowflakeDemo'
      storage_allowed_locations = ('s3://snowflake-demo-3b98x97')
    ```
  - run `describe storage integration snowflake_s3_demo` and copy the values under `STORAGE_AWS_IAM_USER_ARN` and `STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID`. replace the values in the trust policy for principal and external id with this
  - now, we can use the integration object when creating a stage - 
    ```sql
    create or replace stage manage_db.external_stages.csv_folder
      url = 's3://snowflake-demo-3x7'
      storage_integration = snowflake_s3_demo
      file_format = manage_db.file_formats.csv_fileformat
    ```
- snowpipe - enables loading of data automatically when for e.g. a new file is added to the s3 bucket
- snowpipe is serverless i.e. our compute is not used for this
- this near realtime ability is achieved via s3 notifications sent to snowflake managed sqs queue
- setting up a snowpipe - 
  - create a pipe - 
    ```sql
    create pipe snowpipe_demo.public.s3
      auto_ingest = true as
          copy into snowpipe_demo.public.employee
              from @snowpipe_demo.public.s3_csv
              file_format = snowpipe_demo.public.csv
              pattern = '.*employee.*\.csv';
    ```
  - run the describe command to grab the queue arn - `describe pipe snowpipe_demo.public.s3`
  - set up event notification on the s3 bucket with this sqs arn as the destination
- to view pipes, use `show pipes` or we can specify database as well using `show pipes in database snowpipe_demo`
- to make changes to the pipe, pause it first - 
  ```sql
  alter pipe snowpipe_demo.public.s3 set pipe_execution_paused = true;
  ```
- even if we want to make changes to data, e.g. to have existing files picked up the snowpipe, pause the snowpipe before running the copy command manually to load the data of existing files
- time travel - e.g. we make an erroneous update like this - 
  ```sql
  update test set first_name = 'Shameek';
  ```
- we can now go back in time to look at what the data looked like before the erroneous update - 
  ```sql
  -- go back a specific amount of seconds
  select * from test at (offset => -60 * 2);
  -- OR go back to a certain timestamp
  alter session set timezone = 'UTC';
  select current_timestamp;
  select * from test at (timestamp => '2023-07-28 03:36:21.779'::timestamp);
  -- OR before a certain query (the erroneous update in this case) was executed
  select * from test before (statement => '01adeb9c-0604-af37-0000-007bd70792b5');
  ```
- note - for the `before` statement query issued above, snowflake has a history of all queries executed which we can see in the ui
- e.g. of restoring - 
  ```sql
  truncate table test;
  insert into test (
    select * from test before (statement => '01adebc9-0604-af9c-0000-007bd707b315')
  );
  ```
- optionally, load the time traveled data into a backup table and then load it from here into the original table instead of loading the data into the original table directly as described above
- if we accidentally drop a table / schema / database, we can run the undrop command, e.g. `undrop table test` to restore it
  - optionally, if we accidentally run `create or replace table test...`, we can restore the test table before the replace command was executed by first renaming the current wrongly instantiated table, e.g. `alter table test rename to test_aux`, and then running the undrop command to restore the test table before the replace to our database
- we can go back upto 90 days in editions enterprise and above, and upto 1 day in standard edition. however, the default is set to 1. therefore, we have to change the retention period manually to 90 days for editions other than standard - 
  ```sql
  alter table test_tt set data_retention_time_in_days = 2;
  ```
- failsafe - protection of historical data in case of a disaster
- the failsafe period **starts after the time travel period ends**
- the failsafe period is for 7 days
- this is not queryable / usable by front users like in time travel. the idea is to reach out to snowflake support after a disaster occurs to restore the table to a previous state
- the failsafe period cannot be configured like time travel
- table type - table type is a property of the table. the different table types are - 
  - permanent tables - this is the default. we have both time travel (0-90 days) and failsafe
  - transient tables - we have time travel (0-1 day). but no failsafe
    ```sql
    create or replace transient table -- ...
    ```
  - temporary - we have time travel (0-1 day) but no failsafe. note - this is only scoped to a session i.e. we loose this table when the session is closed / cannot view it from other sessions
    ```sql
    create or replace temporary table -- ...
    ```
- the types above are not only scoped to a table, but to database / schemas as well
- we would pay for additional storage for failsafe / time travel, so use transient tables for "reproducible" data like staging layer of warehouse?
- **zero copy cloning** - when we use the clone command, the new table reuses the data and metadata of the older table. this way, it is cost efficient. the additional updates however do not effect one another
- we can clone storage objects (databases, tables, schemas) and stages, file formats, tasks, etc
- we can use time travel with cloning as well - 
  ```sql
  create table cloned
    clone source
    before (timestamp => ...)
  ```
- swap table / schemas - swaps the underlying metadata and data as well
  ```sql
  alter table swap_demo.public.development
    swap with swap_demo.public.production;
  ```
- data sharing - data is not copied again, so it is automatically immediately up to date for the consumer
- snowflake users it is shared with have to use their own compute resources for this
- creating a share - 
  ```sql
  create or replace share orders_share;
  grant usage on database data_share_demo to share orders_share;
  grant usage on schema data_share_demo.public to share orders_share;
  grant select on table data_share_demo.public.orders to share orders_share;
  ```
- add account to share - 
  ```sql
  alter share orders_share add account = <<consumer-account>>;
  ```
- create a database from the share inside the consumer account - 
  ```sql
  create database orders_db from share <<producer-account>>.orders_share;
  ```
- now, the consumer can start consuming the data from this newly created database
- till now, we assumed that the consumers have their own snowflake account when sharing data. non snowflake users can access shares via a reader account. however, our compute is used in this case
- create a reader account
  ```sql
  create managed account analytics
    admin_name = analytics
    admin_password = 'P4$$w0rcl'
    type = reader;
  ```
- add the reader account to the share - 
  ```sql
  show managed accounts; -- use the value of "locator" for the value below
  alter share orders_share add account = QBB35692;
  ```
- in the reader account, create database from share - 
  ```sql
  show shares;
  create database orders_db from share <<producer-account>>.orders_share;
  ```
- create a virtual warehouse inside the reader account (looks like parent account virtual warehouses and reader account virtual warehouses are not exposed to each other?)
- for granting select on all tables in a database / schema - 
  ```sql
  -- instead of
  grant select on table data_share_demo.public.orders to share orders_share;
  -- do
  grant select on all tables in database data_share_demo to share orders_share;
  -- or 
  grant select on all tables in schema data_share_demo.public to share orders_share;
  ```
- views - e.g. instead of sharing all data, we want to share some restricted data. we can do this via views. e.g. - 
  ```sql
  create or replace view data_share_demo.public.loan_payments_cpo as (
    select loan_id, principal
      from data_share_demo.public.loan_payments
      where loan_status = 'COLLECTION_PAIDOFF'
  );
  ```
- however, the issue with the above is for e.g. if we grant a role select on this view, and if a user with that role runs the command `show views`, they can view things like view definition. ideally, i would not have wanted to expose the fact that loan_status maintains an enum, since it is not even present in the projection clause of the view creation statement
- creating a secure view - `create or replace secure view...`
- note - we cannot use shares with normal views, we have to use secure views
- data sampling - use a subset of dataset when for e.g. testing workflows out
- two methods of sampling in snowflake - 
  - row or bernoulli method - every row is chosen with a probability of percentage p. so, it maybe more random since continuous rows are not chosen
  ```sql
  select * from snowflake_sample_data.tpcds_sf10tcl.customer_address
    sample row (1) seed (25); -- seed helps reproduce same results when using randomness
  ```
  - block or system method - every block is chosen with a probability of percentage p. so, it maybe a bit more quicker, since it uses micro partitions
  ```sql
  select * from snowflake_sample_data.tpcds_sf10tcl.customer_address
    sample system (1) seed (25);
  ```
- tasks - it stores an sql statement that can be scheduled to be executed at a certain time or interval
  ```sql
  create or replace task task_db.public.customer_insert
    warehouse = compute_wh
    schedule = '1 minute'
    as
    insert into customers (created_date) values (current_timestamp);
  ```
- notice how tasks use our compute unlike snowpipe, materialized views, etc?
- on running `show tasks`, feels like tasks are suspended by default. so, run the following - 
  ```sql
  alter task task_db.public.customer_insert resume;
  ```
- for crons, - `schedule = 'USING CRON * * * * * UTC'`
- tree of tasks - a root task, which can then have children (multiple levels are allowed). one child task can have one parent task, but one parent task can have multiple children. when declaring a child task, instead of `schedule`, we use `after task_db.public.parent_task`
- note - i think the parent task needs to be suspended first i.e. we first suspend the parent task, create and resume the child task and then finally resume the parent task, else we get an error. even as a best practice that feels right
- getting execution history of tasks like errors, completion time, etc. it also has records for the next queued execution
  ```sql
  select * from table(task_db.information_schema.task_history(task_name => 'customer_insert'));
  ```
- tasks can also have a `when` clause, and the task is executed only if the condition evaluates to true, else the task is skipped
- streams - helps with cdc (change data capture) to capture the delta (changes) of the source data. so, streams help capture dml (i.e. crud) changes
- we only pay for the storage of metadata columns of the stream that helps determine whether the row was deleted, updated, etc. the rows in streams reference the original source for the actual data
- create a stream - 
  ```sql
  create or replace stream streams_demo.public.sales_raw_stream
      on table streams_demo.public.sales_raw;
  ```
- we can run select on the stream table just like we would on a normal table
  ```sql
  select * from streams_demo.public.sales_raw_stream;
  ```
- the stream has three additional columns - `METADATA$ACTION`, `METADATA$ISUPDATE`, `METADATA$ROW_ID`
- once we process the stream, the data in the stream is deleted. it feels like stream is like an "auto generated temporary staging layer" of the warehouse. e.g. if i insert into a table by running a select on the stream table, the stream table clears up
- an update corresponds to two rows in streams - an insert and a delete for `METADATA$ACTION`, and true for `METADATA$ISUPDATE` in both rows. so, `METADATA$ACTION` is always either insert or delete, and we need to determine if the change is due to an update using `METADATA$ISUPDATE`
- e.g. of using streams - imagine store is a static reference table. we want to process the changes in sales table to a table used for analytics, that is like a join between sales and store tables. so, we can assume that for every record in the sales table, there would be a record in this sales analytics table, with added information about the store. so, the stream is needed for the sales table, and not the store table, and we update the final table used for analytics by joining the sales stream table and store reference table
  ```sql
  create or replace stream streams_demo.public.sales_raw_stream
    on table streams_demo.public.sales_raw;

  merge into streams_demo.public.sales_final sf
  using (
      select sa.*, st.employees, st.location
      from streams_demo.public.sales_raw_stream sa
      join streams_demo.public.store_raw st
      on sa.store_id = st.store_id
  ) src
  on src.id = sf.id
      when
          matched
          and src.METADATA$ACTION = 'DELETE'
          and not src.METADATA$ISUPDATE
          then delete
      when
          matched
          and src.METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT'
          and src.METADATA$ISUPDATE
          then update set
              sf.product = src.product,
              sf.price = src.price,
              sf.amount = src.amount,
              sf.store_id = src.store_id,
              sf.location = src.location,
              sf.employees = src.employees
      when
          not matched
          and src.METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT'
          and not src.METADATA$ISUPDATE
          then insert values (
            src.id,
            src.product,
            src.price,
            src.amount,
            src.store_id,
            src.location,
            src.employees
          );       
  ```
- we can use streams in the `when` clause of tasks! so, we can pretty much build an entire etl pipeline just using snowflake - 
  ```sql
  when system$stream_has_data('stream-name')
  as -- the entire sql for stream processing defined above
  ```
- stream types - standard and append-only. append-only captures only inserts while standard captures inserts, updates and deletes.  default is standard as seen above
- change tracking - tables have a change tracking property. we can set it to true as follows - 
  ```sql
  alter table names set change_tracking = true;
  ```
- now, with change tracking enabled, we can basically see the changes in a table in the same format as we saw in streams - 
  ```sql
  select * from names
  changes (information => default)
  at (offset => -240);
  ```
- my understanding - **the difference is that unlike streams, this does not get deleted. its almost like we have a rolling window of cdc until the time travel / retention period**
- again - notice the use of default in the changes clause above. we can also use append_only instead
- materialized view - if we run an expensive query frequently, it can lead to bad user experience. so, we can instead use materialized views
  ```sql
  create or replace materialized view orders_mv as 
  -- ...
  ```
- so, materialized views are updated automatically when its base tables are updated. this updating is maintained by snowflake itself. when we query using materialized view, data is always current
- this means that if the materialized view has not been updated completely by the time we initiate a query, snowflake will use the up to date portions of the materialized view and fetch the remaining data from the base tables
- since background services of snowflake are being used for updating materialized views, it adds to the cost independent of our virtual warehouses
- use materialized views if data is not changing frequently and view computation is expensive. if data is changing frequently, use change tracking / streams + tasks
- [has a lot of limitations i think ðŸ˜­](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/views-materialized#limitations-on-creating-materialized-views) - joins, some aggregation functions, having clause, etc are not supported at the time of writing
- dynamic data masking - returns masked results for security purpose, e.g. pii (personally identifiable information)
  ```sql
  create or replace masking policy phone
    as (val varchar) returns varchar -> 
      case
        when current_role() in ('ACCOUNTADMIN') then val
        else '#####'
      end;
  
  alter table customers
    modify column phone_number
    set masking policy phone;
  ```
- some more masking policy examples - 
  - we just want to see the domain of the emails - 
    ```sql
    when current_role() not in ('ACCOUNTADMIN') then regexp_replace(val, '+\@', '****@')
    ```
  - we want to be able to do comparisons, e.g. we want to join by name, but we do not want to allow seeing of the names. we can use `sha2(val)`, so that while users see an encrypted value, it is a consistent hash, so running it on the same value will produce the same result

### Access Management

- rbac (role based access control) i.e. privileges are assigned to roles, which are inturn assigned to users
- in snowflake we have dac (discretionary access control) i.e. every object has an owner, who can grant access to that resource. so, all objects have an owner, which is a role, and this role has all privileges on that object by default. the objects on which we can grant privileges are also called securable objects, e.g. warehouses, databases, tables, etc
- role hierarchy - the parent role will automatically have the privileges of all of its child roles
- my understanding
  - a user can have multiple roles
  - the public role is assigned to all new users by default
  - the default role is the one that determines what role to use when for e.g. a new worksheet is opened by the user, or maybe like when no role is specified
  - for all roles to be used, set secondary role to all. e.g. we have a system account, which has warehouse access via a different role, and access to tables via yet another role. we cannot specify both roles in for e.g. the jdbc url. so, we can instead set the secondary role to all for permissions from all roles to kick in for a user anytime the user makes a query
- system defined roles - 
  - account admin - 
    - the top level role
    - can manage things like reader accounts
    - avoid using this, and users using this should use mfa
    - do not create objects using this, as otherwise we would have to manually add privileges to users that need it (it is at the top of hierarchy so no role inherits "from" it)
    - only account admin can view things like usage / billing information
  - security admin -
    - can manage any object grant globally - my doubt - does this mean it can do this for objects that it (or its nested children) do not own as well?
    - can be used to create and manage roles but thats usually done by useradmin?
    - example - (note the hierarchy i.e. sales_user is a child of sales_admin, which is inturn a child of sysadmin. this is a best practice)
      ```sql
      create or replace role sales_admin;
      create or replace role sales_user;

      grant role sales_user to role sales_admin;
      grant role sales_admin to role sysadmin;

      create or replace user simon_sales_user
          password = 'p@$$worcl'
          default_role = sales_user;
      grant role sales_user to user simon_sales_user;

      create or replace user olivia_sales_admin
          password = 'p@$$worcl'
          default_role = sales_admin;
      grant role sales_admin to user olivia_sales_admin;
      ```
  - sysadmin -
    - create warehouses, databases, etc
    - custom roles should be attached to sysadmin as a best practice. this way, the objects created by these custom roles can be managed by sysadmin. otherwise, this would not be possible
    - example - we run the below from inside sysadmin. despite us granting ownership to sales_admin, sysadmin can still perform all the operations on these objects since sysadmin inherits permissions from sales_admin. refer above, this setup was basically done by security admin
      ```sql
      create or replace database sales_db;
      grant ownership on database sales_db to role sales_admin;
      grant ownership on schema sales_db.public to role sales_admin;
      ```
    - now, from inside sales_admin, we can run the below - 
      ```sql
      grant usage on database sales_db to role sales_user;
      grant usage on schema sales_db.public to role sales_user;
      grant select on table sales_db.public.customers to role sales_user;
      ```
  - useradmin - 
    - used to create / manage users and roles
    - unlike securityadmin, it does not have ability to grant privileges to all objects, only on objects that it owns
  - public role 
    - every user is granted this role by default

## Snowflake Architecture

- **query processing** - 
  - uses **virtual warehouses**
  - _each_ virtual warehouse is a mpp cluster of compute nodes
  - its **size** (ranging from xs to 6xl) governs the compute, memory, cpu, etc it will have
  - each increase in size almost _doubles_ the compute power
  - account for most of the credit consumption
  - scale statically or dynamically using **multi cluster warehouses**
- **storage** - 
  - store in columnar format
  - use compression when storing to reduce size by 3-5 times
  - cost of storage is typically negligible
- **cloud services** - 
  - brain of the platform
  - login, query dispatch, query optimization, key management for encryption, etc
  - runs on compute managed by snowflake
- snowflake is saas - all three layers of snowflake run on selected cloud provider - aws, gcp, azure
- we also need to select the region based on the cloud provider we choose
- choice of these influence our cost of snowflake infrastructure, data egress costs, etc

## Snowflake Costs

- we are charged using **credits**. it is a unit of measure which is consumed when we use snowflake resources
- our cost = compute + storage + data transfer + cloud services + serverless
- compute cost - 
  - three factors - number of virtual warehouses, size of virtual warehouses and how long they run
  - we are charged even if the warehouse is idle
  - we are not charged when the warehouse is **suspended** - so, guard rails like **auto suspend** are important to save costs
  - we are charged for a minimum of 60 seconds, and every second the warehouse is not suspended from then
- storage cost - 
  - the default compression leads to reduced costs
  - calculated based on average terabytes used daily over the month
  - three main costs - data in stages, data stored in tables, features like failsafe and time travel
  - also influenced by type of storage - **on demand** vs **capacity** - capacity is pre purchased, thus leading to much lesser costs
- data transfer cost - 
  - cost is incurred if data is transferred
    - from one region to another
    - from one cloud to another
  - a **data egress** charge is applied by the cloud providers - data ingress is typically free
  - charge is per byte
- cloud services cost - 
  - collection of services like metadata management, query processing and optimization, authentication, etc
  - charged if consumption exceeds 10% of total compute resources
  - it is calculated on a daily basis
- serverless cost - 
  - uses compute managed by snowflake
  - snowflake automatically decides the ideal size and scales its compute automatically based on it
  - cost is per second per core
  - each serverless feature appears as a different line item in the bill
  - costs incurred by some of the different serverless features are described below
  - snowpipe - loads data from stages to tables automatically
    - compute costs
    - costs for number of files processed
  - materialized views - 
    - cost of compute used for the pre computation using the background process
    - storage costs
  - database replication - 
    - costs of compute for the synchronization
    - cost of data transfer from one region to another
    - cost of storage used by target database 
  - search optimization - used when selective filters used repeatedly only return a small amount of rows from the huge data. an "access path structure" is maintained for the efficient querying
    - storage costs for maintaining the structure
    - compute costs for maintaining the structure
  - clustering - snowflake stores data in a sorted way to improve query performance. can be automatic or based on columns we specify
    - costs for initial clustering
    - costs for reclustering - reclustering happens periodically when our dml causes the clustering to fall out of sync significantly

## Cost Governance Framework

- **visibility** - understand, attribute and monitor the spend. e.g. [dashboards](#dashboards), [tagging](#query-tagging), [resource monitors](#resource-monitors)
- **control** - [limit and control](#control-strategies) the spend
- **optimization** - optimize the spend

## Dashboards

### Consumption Dashboard

- admin -> cost management -> consumption will show credit consumption 

![](/assets/img/warehouse-and-snowflake/consumption%20dashboard.png)

- usage type - select one of 
  - compute - guessing compute includes all three - user managed warehouses, serverless features and cloud services
  - storage
  - data transfer

- in this dashboard, we can change the grouping (by service, by resource, etc), change the date range (last 7 days, last 28 days, etc), and so on

### Custom Dashboard 1

- based on how we group, we either see for e.g. costs incurred by different database, or costs incurred by failsafe vs database
- there is a read only database called `snowflake`, with a schema called `account_usage`. it has several views which contain data about the historical usage and costs associated with it 
- `warehouse_metering_history` - per virtual warehouse consumption at an hourly level
  ```sql
  select
      date_trunc('day', start_time),
      credits_used,
      credits_used_cloud_services,
      credits_used_compute
  from
      snowflake_finance.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history
  where
      start_time = :daterange
  ```
- i guess `credits_used` = `credits_used_cloud_services` + `credits_used_compute`
- using the daterange filter helps us pick custom date ranges from the date picker
- now, when creating a bar chart, values in x axis are unique. therefore, we need to select an aggregation type for values in y axis. we use sum
- my understanding - right now, we fetch all records in the given range, and rely on our tile configuration capabilities. we can rely on the query to do that as well
  ```sql
  select
      date_trunc('day', start_time),
      sum(credits_used),
      sum(credits_used_cloud_services),
      sum(credits_used_compute)
  from
      snowflake_finance.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history
  where
      start_time = :daterange
  group by
      1
  ```
- note - in our tile configuration, we will still have to provide the aggregation function etc, since the tile does not understand we have already ensured unique values for our x axis
- **orientation** can be vertical or horizontal
- **grouping** can be grouped (one beside another) or stacked (one on top of another)
- we can also identify the direction of ordering etc

![](/assets/img/warehouse-and-snowflake/custom-dashboard-1-warehouse.png)

- till now, whatever we saw till now tells us credits used by virtual warehouses. these include - 
  - virtual warehouses managed by us
  - virtual warehouses managed y cloud services
- we can also monitor credits used by serverless compute. recall how it is broken down by services
- so, we use `metering_history` for this, and filter out the rows for virtual warehouses by using `service_type != 'WAREHOUSE_METERING'` (we already created a chart for the warehouse_metering table above)
  ```sql
  select
      date_trunc('month', start_time),
      service_type,
      sum(credits_used)
  from
      snowflake_marketing.account_usage.metering_history
  where
      start_time = :daterange
      and service_type != 'WAREHOUSE_METERING'
  group by
      1, 2
  ```

![](/assets/img/warehouse-and-snowflake/custom-dashboard-1-serverless.png)

### Custom Dashboard 2

- we can for e.g. budget 18,000 credits for snowflake for a year - this means 18,000 / 12 = 1500 credits per month
- we can also establish a **baseline** - forecast based on usage values over previous months
- note - while we are calculating these values in our dashboard, we would ideally store it in a table and query it for our tile
  ```sql
  set baseline_start_date = '2021-09-01';
  set baseline_end_date = '2021-12-31';
  
  set baseline = (
      select
          round(sum(credits_used), 2) / 4
      from
          snowflake_finance.account_usage.metering_history
      where
          start_time between $baseline_start_date and $baseline_end_date
  );
  ```
- now, we can create the chart for the expected / baseline / budgeted amount vs the actual consumed credits - 
  ```sql
  select
      date_trunc('month', start_time),
      sum(credits_used),
      $baseline baseline
  from
      snowflake_finance.account_usage.metering_history
  where
      start_time = :daterange
  group by
      1
  ```
- the chart looks as follows - 
  ![](/assets/img/warehouse-and-snowflake/custom-dashboard-ii-baseline-vs-actual-without-bucketing.png)
- issue - the chart is not **bucketed** for the x axis properly. choose bucketing as month
  ![](/assets/img/warehouse-and-snowflake/custom-dashboard-ii-baseline-vs-actual-with-bucketing.png)
- final improvement - our budgeted amount adds up - e.g. if we budgeted 1500 credits, it adds up over the month, it does not stay at a constant. so does our consumption. such calculations are also called **year to date** i believe
  ```sql
  with usage as (
      select
          date_trunc('month', start_time) month,
          sum(credits_used) credits_used,
          $baseline credits_expected
      from
          snowflake_finance.account_usage.metering_history
      where
          start_time = :daterange
      group by
          1
  )
  select
      month,
      sum(credits_used) over (order by month) total_credits_used_till_now,
      sum(credits_expected) over (order by month) total_credits_expected_till_now
  from
      usage
  ```
- so, we use window functions. my understanding - we only need cumulative, and so we use the sum function and order by month. we do need to partition using a column
  ![](/assets/img/warehouse-and-snowflake/custom-dashboard-ii-baseline-vs-actual-year-to-date.png)

## Warehouse Utilization

- track this using `warehouse_load_history`
- `avg_queued_load` - average number of queries queued - 
  - warehouse was overloaded - evaluate using multi cluster warehouses
  - this might also indicate that our warehouses have been spinning up and down frequently, thus being unable to cache data efficiently and therefore return results quickly. solution - evaluate settings for auto suspend and auto resume, ensure that the same warehouse is used for the same query, etc
  
  ```sql
  select
      start_time,
      avg_queued_load
  from
      snowflake_marketing.account_usage.warehouse_load_history
  where
      start_time = :daterange
  ```

![](/assets/img/warehouse-and-snowflake/warehouse-utilization-queued-load.png)

- `avg_running` - average number of queries executed
  - recall that a single virtual warehouse is a cluster of compute nodes
  - consolidation - if we have two bi applications that rarely use a warehouse concurrently, we can use the same warehouse for both of the applications to reduce costs

  ```sql
  select
      date_trunc('day', start_time),
      max(avg_running)
  from
      snowflake_marketing.account_usage.warehouse_load_history
  where
      start_time = :daterange
  group by
      1
  ```

![](/assets/img/warehouse-and-snowflake/warehouse-utilization-running.png)

## Object Tagging

- we need to **bucket** costs by attributing it with tags
- **chargeback model** - apply costs of it services to the business team that uses them
- creating tags and adding it to objects -
  ```sql
  create tag "635de402978_tag" comment = 'product name';
  
  alter table product2_tbla set tag "635de402978_tag" = '6b27e2dc9_value';

  select * from snowflake.account_usage.tag_references;
  ```
- querying using tags -  
  ```sql
  use database snowflake;
  use schema account_usage;
  
  select
      tag_references.tag_value,
      sum(table_storage_metrics.active_bytes) total_bytes,
      count(*) total_tables
  from
      tag_references
      left join table_storage_metrics on table_storage_metrics.id = tag_references.object_id
  where
      tag_references.domain = 'TABLE'
      and tag_references.tag_name = '635de402978_TAG'
  group by
      tag_references.tag_value
  ```
- below points are my understanding -
  - the table `tag_references` in `snowflake.account_usage` will give us what object is tagged with what
  - we can now perform a join with tables like `table_storage_metrics`
  - we perform a join - maybe because objects to tags is one to many. maybe a left join is used to report 0 for business units with no objects
  - we filter for only objects of type table and the tag we are looking to report on - e.g. product name in our case
  - we group using the distinct tag values, and perform an aggregation on the active bytes

## Query Tagging

- **object tagging** allows us to tag objects like databases, warehouses, etc
- **query tagging** allows us to tag queries
- while we _do not_ have access to the credits consumed for these queries
- we do have access to things like partitions scanned, average time elapsed, etc
- e.g. tag all the queries in a dashboard to efficiently get analytics around the queries in it
  ```sql
  alter session set query_tag = 'xyz';
  ```
- running analysis on this - 
  ```sql
  select
      count(*) total_selects,
      avg(total_elapsed_time) avg_run_time,
      date_trunc('day', start_time) date
  from
      snowflake_marketing.account_usage.query_history
  where
      start_time = :daterange
      and query_tag = 'query tag f493ed5ca5aecf3b77b2c154cdc0b708'
      and query_type = 'SELECT'
  group by
      date
  ```

## Resource Monitors

- **resource monitors** - warehouses can be assigned resource monitors
- we can define a limit on the number of credits consumed - when this limit is reached, we can be notified
- notification works on both user managed warehouses and warehouses managed by cloud services

![](/assets/img/warehouse-and-snowflake/resource-monitor-visiblity.png)

- in the above resource monitor, we - 
  - set credit quota to 1
  - monitor type - we can monitor the entire account or only a specific warehouse
  - select the warehouse to monitor - a warehouse can have only one resource monitor, but the same resource monitor can be used for multiple warehouses
  - start monitoring immediately, and never stop monitoring
  - reset the monitor daily - it starts tracking from 0 again
  - notify when 75% and 100% of the quota is consumed
- i ran this statement to modify the users to be notified - 
  ```sql
  alter resource monitor costgov_wh_rm set notify_users = ('COSTGOV_LEARNER');
  ```
- finally, on reaching the consumption, i get an email as follows - 

![](/assets/img/warehouse-and-snowflake/resource-monitor-notification.png)

- note - i also had to enable receiving notifications in my profile - 

![](/assets/img/warehouse-and-snowflake/enable-resource-monitor-notifications.png)

- till now, we saw the **visibility** aspect of resource monitors, now we look at its **control** aspect
- we can only suspend user managed warehouses, not ones managed by cloud services
- we can choose to suspend either after running queries complete, or after cancelling all running queries

## Control Strategies

- **virtual warehouses** can be **single cluster** or **multi cluster**
- changing warehouse size helps with vertical scaling (scaling up) i.e. processing more complex queries
- using multi cluster warehouse helps with horizontal scaling (scaling out) i.e. processing more concurrent queries
- some features of warehouses include to control spend include -
  - **auto suspend** - automatically suspend warehouses if there is no activity
  - **auto resume** - automatically restart the warehouse when there are new queries
  - **auto scaling** - start warehouses dynamically if queries are queued. bring them down when queue becomes empty. there are two scaling policies - **standard** and **economic**. first prefers starting additional warehouses, while the second prefers conserving credits
- `statement_queued_timeout_in_seconds` - statements are dropped if queued for longer than this. default is 0 i.e. never dropped
- `statement_timeout_in_seconds` - statements are cancelled if they run for longer than this. default is 48hrs
